# Introduction

---

Here is a collection of Firefox userChromeJS scripts.

Almost all scripts were presented or adapted there in the German Firefox forum.

For GitHub, the scripts are stored in sub-folders with the corresponding README files. It's about
Text files in markdown format with the file extension `md`. Screenshots up to 09/30/2017 were created in Firefox 57.
The results of the scripts updated for newer Firefox versions may look a little different. The screenshots
are only updated if there are extreme differences.
